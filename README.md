Paul Conway Personal Project for CIS 440

This is a tool I came across recently and was interested in the idea of it, SourceLair is an in browser IDE that supports 
many languages including Python, Ruby, SQL, C/C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and Java. As it is cloud based there is only
the need of internet access to access the IDE and continue developing your project. The setup is very simple, sign up for an
account and you are ready to program. Additionally there is allegedly git integration within SourceLiar, however I was not able
to figure out how to push or pull anything from the IDE to my repository. 

With the difficulty that our group had with the setup in Grails I see a great benefit in being able to setup an IDE online and
acccessing the IDE from anywhere. No more worrying about conflicting IDE versions and transferring files between one computer
and another. Hopefully more IDEs become cloud based as I think for someone developing personal projects SourceLair will add a
level of conveniece the will not only benefit experienced programmers but those looking for an easy IDE to start learning 
programming.
